<p>Hey everyone! I'm Aarush Mehrotra, currently a high school junior at Oakridge International School. </p>
<p>I am a digital creator, a published author best known for my children's book Diary of a Tree, and an aspiring software developer.</p>
<p>I have a certification in Digital Storytelling from Midwestern University, Illinois and my goal in 2021 is to lend my skills- and my voice- 
  to the people and causes that are close to my heart. To start off this year, my channel has created an interview series 
  with different people from different parts of my life. I'd like to share their stories, their actions, and the change that they have created with all of you. The latest videos from the series will be embedded on this page as they are released!</p>
<!-- <h1 class="heading">Hi! I'm Aarush Mehrotra, a 10th grade student currently in India. To understand who I am, I believe you need to understand where I come from.</h1>
<h2>The beginning</h2>
<p>I was born on December 8, 2004, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. </p> -->
